## Deck timeline

### All of these issues were not disclosed by previous owners

1.  Noticed main overhang from support post to support joist was sagging, and deck overhang had damages that needed fixing

1.  Gusset that is apart of the balcony frame sagging causing extreme dip on the balcony floor

1.  Broken hand rails (Inspector noted this as well)
1.  Floating deck foundational support beams. The support beam was not dig out deep enough to where over time the erosion removed enough sand/dirt to where the beam was no longer touching the ground

     <figcaption>
        There were other foundational support beams that had missing cement for a footer that have been fixed
     </figcaption>
  </figure>
  </div>

1.  Had conversations with next door neighbors about how the previous owners "knew they needed to get to working on the deck" and "really want to get to the deck"
1.  Rotting on the beams in landing
1.  Stairs from landing to back yard
1.  Support beams for the balcony were sitting on top of the deck (did not go into the foundation) and were empty not up to code for supporting the balcony
    - Matt has since replaced those beams with structural schedule 40 that goes in the foundation past what is required for this area which brought the balcony back up to being level which was almost 3 inches
1.  Got the okay from my HOA that I did not need to submit an architectural request for the work being done
1.  Incorrectly poured footing on the stairs that lead to the backyard
    - The concrete was not poured all the way around the footer to where you could easily pull them out of the ground
1.  Missing handrail for the stairs to the backyard causing violations of shelby county code

## Foundation timeline

### All of the issues were missed by the home inspector and were not disclosed

1.  Matt (contractor working on my deck remodel) noticed foundation issues

1.  Neighbors mentioned previous owners had sidewalk cave in around the time of the house being put on the market
1.  Emailed my HOA asking if there was past record of work done for where they repaved the conrete from being caved in, there was no records/disclourse
1.  I noticed the downspout in the courtyard that is connected to the flower bed that is up against the whole under the AC unit was installed incorrectly where water from 1/3 of the house was gushing out of it and not only soakling the flower bed but stripping paint of the siding in that section only adding onto to more erosion in the hole. Matt noticed the current gutter guards that were installed by previous owners were allowing water to topple over it and not go down the drain during heavy rain.

    </div>

- Matt fixed both of these issues by replacing all gutter guards and fixing the downspout to have the gutter properly connected to where water would not escape costing $600 for just the labor

1. Called DFX, Kermit B. Buck & Sons, INC., Redeemers Group, and Olshan to come out for quotes
   - All companies confirmed there is foundation failure with different recommendations as to how they would fix the slab with a pier/pillar
   - Olshan was the best plan for structural support across the whole house. Including external and internal pillars to ensure the area of influence of each pillar fixed my current issues and did not leave any gaps or areas where there could be future issues. The Olshan recommended plan putting 20 external pillars and 14 internal pillars costs $43,235.00 (not including cost to repair holes inside and rollup neighbors turf carpet to drill). I worked with them to create a modified plan to cover all the areas that are of high to medium priority that would include 13 external pillars and 6 internal pillars which costs $24,375.00 (not including cost to repair holes inside and rollup neighbors turf carpet to drill).
   - When Olshan came the guy (Tim) off the start told me he had been to this house before. He was the one who came and gave the quote and did the work on the sidewalk area that the previous owners had done. He was able to pull up the exact photos from his ipad when quoting and having the work done. Mentioned that he wanted to inspect inside the house but the owner did not let him and made him only stay outside and work on the sidewalk.
   - When Tim was inspecting the inside of the house for cracks, issues with the doors/windows, etc. He noted that there were clear signs of covering up cracks with fresh painting (past owners replaced all windows, floors, and repainted right before selling the house)/new trim work.
   - Tim noted there was areas all throughout the first floor of the house where the grade was as bad as 3 inches below level
